# Ridgeline_Plot_Vaccination
R Code for Ridgeline Plots for Scotland Covid Vaccination

This is my first R project, (be kind) and have used a build example as a way to further my understanding on the fundamentals along the way.
I am conscious I've probably committed a few naming convention sins (mixing cases) and certain have bloaty code, but will intend to come back to this at a later date to revise, when have tighter R skills.

Background: 
I took inspiriation from a visualisation from Python, and wanted to recreate in ScotlandL
